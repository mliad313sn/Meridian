# Changelog

Every change to Meridian is versioned, and every version says what
changed and **why it was wrong before**. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the numbering
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

What the numbers mean for an application rather than a library:

- **MAJOR** — an operator has to do something before upgrading: a manual
  migration step, a configuration change, a removed command.
- **MINOR** — new capability. Migrations apply themselves at boot.
- **PATCH** — a defect closed, or a document corrected. No new capability.

Unreleased work sits under `## [Unreleased]` until it is tagged.

## [5.1.0] — 2026-08-31

The release that made Meridian free software, and closed the defects that
preparing it for other people made visible.

### Added

- **Lessons register** (PM-02, migration `024`). The gate model demanded
  “Realisation report, lessons learned” as evidence at gate 4 and the
  product had nowhere to put a lesson: it required a document it made
  impossible to produce. Whoever lived it proposes; the programme office
  adopts, and adoption is what makes it readable at the other sites. An
  adopted lesson crosses sites without naming the project it came from,
  so it never becomes a way to discover work outside your scope.
- **Named integrations with scoped keys** (INT-02, migration `025`), and
  the first `/api/v1` surface. One key per connected system, an explicit
  scope per key, rotation, revocation, and every act attributed **by
  name** in the audit trail. A key that only reads the portfolio is
  refused on the audit trail, and told what it holds.
- **Archive and restore** (M-01). One open file carrying the whole book
  *and* the audit trail, with no secret in it — so it can be handed to an
  escrow agent or a successor without an argument. `npm run restore`
  loads it elsewhere. This is not a backup, and the code says so.
- **Continuity panel** in Administration: export the archive, or end
  every session. Both existed as routes that no screen called.
- **`npm run admin:handover`** — create the next administrator and retire
  the previous one, in that order, with the new account's password
  verified against scrypt before anything is taken away.
- **Two more build gates.** `kit-imports` checks that every shared helper
  a file calls is a helper it imported; `view-render` boots an instance
  and actually draws all 21 screens under all 4 roles.
- Apache-2.0 licence, `NOTICE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a
  CI workflow that runs the same `npm run verify` a maintainer runs, plus
  the migrations against a real PostgreSQL 17.

### Fixed

- **Administration could not be opened. At all. Since the first release.**
  `administration.js` called `selectField` without importing it; the
  `ReferenceError` was swallowed by the view's `try` and became an empty
  screen. Seven committees, 322 passing tests, six gates and a 286-case
  sweep never saw it, because nothing in the tooling drew a view.
- **A group account could chair any site's meeting** (S-17). The code
  said the route would narrow the scope; no route ever did.
- **Session tokens were stored as they travel** (S-14). Passwords have
  been hashed since day one; the token, which opens the same doors for
  twelve hours, was not. The column is renamed rather than reused, so an
  unconverted call fails loudly instead of silently matching nobody.
- **The sign-in rate limit could be walked around** (S-15). It counted
  identity *and* address together — the one pair an attacker never has to
  keep constant. Three counters now. It was a declared release blocker
  and had no test at all; it has four.
- **The client fetched its fonts from Google on every page load.** Every
  user's browser announced its address to a third party, a site on a poor
  link paid the wait, and the offline mode — an advertised feature —
  degraded. The fonts are packaged; the content-security policy no longer
  names any third-party host, which it had been quietly permitting.
- Delivery of queued notifications was called by no production code, and
  `notification_subscription` was written by a screen and read by nobody.
- A search box rendered its own source code as placeholder text, and a
  form's default project could land on a project the account may read but
  not write — a required field impossible to fill.

### Changed

- A service principal now has an explicit branch in `projectScopeSql`.
  It saw the whole portfolio by falling through the “viewer with no
  grants” case: the right result for the wrong reason, and a rule a
  future change to the viewer case would have reversed by accident.
- `.npmrc` is no longer shipped. A public repository carrying
  `strict-ssl=false` teaches a supply-chain weakness to everyone who
  clones it.

### Security

- The repository was scanned before publication — tracked files and the
  full history — for credentials, connection strings, personal addresses
  and machine paths. The only match is the documented placeholder in
  `.env.example`.

## [5.0.0] — 2026-08-29

The standalone baseline: client/server on PostgreSQL, real
authentication and authorisation, an append-only audit trail, and the
meeting module. Earned value, critical path, stage gates, RAID, change
control with segregation of duties, benefits and post-implementation
review, frozen reporting periods, demand and prioritisation, resource
capacity with rotation and deputies, plant windows and management of
change, evidence probing, the notification centre, adoption measurement,
a training ground, and a bilingual interface.

The reasoning behind each of those lives in `docs/`, one report per
committee, in the order they were held.
